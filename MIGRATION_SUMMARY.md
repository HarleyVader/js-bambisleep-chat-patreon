w:campaigns.webhook
```

### Environment Variables (New/Updated)
```bash
# Required for APIv2
PATREON_CAMPAIGN_ID=your_campaign_id_here

# Existing (no changes needed)
PATREON_CLIENT_ID=your_client_id
PATREON_CLIENT_SECRET=your_client_secret
REDIRECT_URL=http://localhost:8888/oauth/redirect
SESSION_SECRET=your_session_secret

## 🚀 Testing Checklist

### Basic Functionality
- [ ] Application starts without errors
- [ ] `/health` endpoint returns 200
- [ ] `/config` shows all required env vars as ✅
- [ ] OAuth flow completes successfully
- [ ] User authentication works

### APIv2 Endpoints
- [ ] `/api/admin/tiers` returns campaign tiers
- [ ] `/api/admin/members` returns member list (requires auth)
- [ ] `/api/public/campaign-tiers` works without auth
- [ ] Member verification logic works correctly

### Advanced Features
- [ ] Webhook endpoints receive and process events correctly
- [ ] Token refresh works automatically
- [ ] Rate limiting protects against abuse
- [ ] Database operations work (if MongoDB configured)

## 🔄 Breaking Changes from APIv1

### For Developers
1. **Explicit Field Requests**: All API calls now require explicit `fields[resource]=field1,field2` parameters
2. **New Resource Names**: `pledges` → `members`
3. **Pagination Changes**: Cursor-based instead of offset-based
4. **Scope Requirements**: Must update Patreon app with new scopes

### For Users
- No breaking changes for end users
- Authentication flow remains the same
- All existing functionality preserved

## 🐛 Known Issues & Solutions

### Missing PATREON_CAMPAIGN_ID
**Error**: Endpoints return configuration errors
**Solution**: Add your campaign ID to `.env` file

### Invalid Scopes
**Error**: OAuth fails or API returns 403
**Solution**: Update your Patreon app with required APIv2 scopes

### Database Connection Issues
**Error**: MongoDB connection fails
**Solution**: Check MONGODB_URI or disable database features
